#Day 2
We are collecting more data than we can store. Everything is a sensor.

Devices in our modern cell phones are evolving faster than the flash storage options; and that's why a 16GB camera isn't enough.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Think of Lidar for example; 


#Square Kilometre Array
Ground based astronomy. the volume and velocity of the data is staggering; consider that 700TB/s will be generated. A hard disk just won't do!

So we need to identify what information is *important*.
**Data Triage** is the methods for finding what type of data is not important.

#Old unorganized data
The NASA Lunar Recovery Project


#Five V's of data
+ Volume - Total volume at inception, and total volume at the end of the project.
+ Velocity How fast is it comming? I/O, Can we triage the data?
+ Variety Is it too unorganized to be useful? heterogenous in size/structure? What are the types, and are they described?
+ Veracity - the confidence in the data. How big is the error bar? is this a guess?
+ Value: What decisions can be made on this data, and how easy is it to turn this data into knowledge and value?


#XDATA
A company gives a full description of the dataset;

LIFT: All Akami Edgescape data, all bitcoin, all Kiva, NBA, employment, etc.


#Day 3 Jan 19
The internet of things. Showed us a video of a hacker disabling and enabling features on cars
